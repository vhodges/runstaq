Runstaq takes a list of directories and provides an interactive shell
for starting and stopping program(s) within them (using foreman style
Procfiles).

Note:  It's not a devops tool per se, just a way to run a pieces.

Is you app comprised of a number of components spread across multiple
folders/repos?  runstaq will help you get them running locally for
dev/testing.

Usage:

runstaq dir1 dir2...dirN

or

runstaq -stack runstaqfile (which is just a list of folders, one per line)

This will drop you into a shell where you can:

run [foldername]  # Run the stack or if foldername is specified just run
                      that piece of the stack

shutdown [foldername]  # Stop the stack or if foldername is specified just stop
                      that piece of the stack

list [foldername] # The status of the stack or if foldername is specified just 
                      display the status for that piece of the stack

quit                # stop the stack and exit

help                # Print this list

version             # Print version/build info for runstaq


Notes/Future Features

  - run a boot.sh script before starting (bring up infrastructure,
    prime caches, etc)
  - Support for env files
  - Default stack to run (default.staq?)?
